# Weekly Report - Team DroidLabs - 27.04 to 03.05

This weekly report aims at updating the relevant stakeholders regarding the progress of the project,
as well as presenting any relevant information regarding setbacks faced during development.

## 1. Goals from previous week
- Write the blog post related to the first milestone;
- Setup the project repository, together with static analysis tools;
- Have the first meeting with the customer on the 30.04;
- Define a basic set of screens for the application;
- Create the wireframes for the basic screens of the application;
- Create the user requirements based on the meeting with the customer.

## 2. Actual progress
We have completed all the goals from the previous week, except for finishing the wireframes for the
basic set of screens. We have discussed within the group and decided to implement UI-related tasks
after creating a basic Database and screen setup, so that we can better test the UI components.

Additionally, we have decided for 1-week sprints since they allow for faster development and more
targeted milestones.

## 3. Plans for the upcoming week
Our plan for the week of 04.05 until 10.05 is as follows:
- Create the basic Database setup with CRUD operations;
- Create a basic Transaction data model in the application; 
- Implement the basic set of screens in the application;
- Implement a basic top navigation menu;
- Design the wireframes for the application;
