Our application PocketControl will help the user to keep track on their expenses. The application will not only showing the balance of the user but also the categories and transactions that the user have made. The user can add more categories into the application, note the detail of their transaction and they can also create threshold to limit their spends.
Our team is keen on developing a product that offers real value to our customer, and we want to give our best to make an application that can be used beyond the context of the course.

# On the first view:

2. **The prototype will contain all of essential requirements and most of necessary requirements**
3. **Create a presentation for the basic prototype**
