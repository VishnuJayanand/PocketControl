# Weekly Report - Team DroidLabs - 08.05 to 14.05

This weekly report aims at updating the relevant stakeholders regarding the progress of the project,
as well as presenting any relevant information regarding setbacks faced during development.

## 1. Goals from previous week
The goals from the previous week are as follows:
- Finish the basic Database setup with CRUD operations;
- Finish all the basic data models in the application; 
- Design general class and sequence diagrams for the application;
- Create basic fields in the screens to start with the essential functionalities;
- Create the visual identity of the application so that we can standardize the UI components;

## 2. Actual progress
We have completed most of the proposed tasks, with only the visual identity for each specific screen
still pending. We are prioritizing implementing the functionality over creating an appealing UI,
since the UI can be easily adjusted afterwards to comply with our visual guidelines. 

## 3. Plans for the upcoming week
Our plan for the week of 15.05 until 21.05 is as follows:
- Implement the transactions list screen and integrate it with the running database;
- Implement the transaction detail screen and integrate it with the running database;
- Implement the categories list screen and integrate it with the running database;
- Implement the category detail screen and integrate it with the running database;
- Implement the budgets list screen and integrate it with the running database;
- Implement the budget detail screen and integrate it with the running database;
- Start the implementation of transaction filtering by category;


## 4. Agenda for TA meeting:
For now we have a clear plan for the next few weeks, so there are no pressing issues to be discussed
with the TA.
