# Weekly Report - Team DroidLabs - 25.06 to 02.07

This weekly report aims at updating the relevant stakeholders regarding the progress of the project,
as well as presenting any relevant information regarding setbacks faced during development.

## 1. Goals from previous week
Our goals from the previous week (25.06 until 02.07) were as follows:
- work on the feedback from advanced prototype.
- Implement new requirements from the client.
- Check our app in Android 7.


## 2. Actual progress
We have implemented all the requirements from the client, and have addressed all bugs mentioned
by the TA. The application is almost complete, with a few improvements in the UI scheduled for
this week.

## 3. Plans for the upcoming week
Our plan for the week of 09.07 until 15.07 is as follows:
- Adjust a small functionality issue mentioned by the TA. 
- Work on making the UI consistent throughout the application.
- Research on text formatting and, if implementing it fits our schedule, implement the functionality
to allow the user to format the transaction note.
- Create the blog entry and the final version of the application.

## 4. Agenda for TA meeting:
Since there will be no further meetings with the TA, we do not have any items on the agenda.
