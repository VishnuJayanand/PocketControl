# Weekly Report - Team DroidLabs - 25.06 to 02.07

This weekly report aims at updating the relevant stakeholders regarding the progress of the project,
as well as presenting any relevant information regarding setbacks faced during development.

## 1. Goals from previous week
Our plan for the week of 25.06 until 02.07 is as follows:
- work on the feedback from advanced prototype.
- Implement new requirements from the client.
- Check our app in Android 7.


## 2. Actual progress
We have finished implementing all the essential and necessary requirements. We are also 
testing the app in a systematic approach. If time persists, we would try to implement more 
'nice-to-have' features from the initial requirements.

## 3. Plans for the upcoming week
Our plan for the week of 03.07 until 09.07 is as follows:
- Extensive testing of all features.
- Work on fixing all the bugs if present.
- Implement any additional feature if missing.
- Work on Presentation and Blog for the Beta Prototype

## 4. Agenda for TA meeting:
For now we have a clear plan for the next few weeks, so there are no pressing issues to be discussed
with the TA. We would like to get feedback for the app as usual.
