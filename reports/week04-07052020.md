The following tasks have been already completed:

- Create basic fields in the screens to start with the essential functionalities;
- Create the visual identity of the application so that we can standardize the UI components;

## 4. Agenda for TA meeting:
For now we have a clear plan for the next few weeks, so there are no pressing issues to be discussed
with the TA.
